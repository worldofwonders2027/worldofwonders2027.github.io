		<p>Virtual YouTubing in 2027 is a very beautiful world.</p>
		</br>
		<p>The practices of Phase Connect have inspired other paths of virtual YouTubing, some which Phase Connect has been doing to some extent, like the traditional idol.</p>
		<p>They have inspired everyone to be themselves.</p>
		</br>
		<p>They have created a virtual YouTubing that is such a positive environment that hurting someone is impossible, such that truly, no rules are necessary. Something virtual YouTubing has shown to the world - the power of persevering in believing in *everyone*, and how great it is.</p>
		</br>
		<p>Gura can collaborate, let's say, with whoever she wishes, and can do endless things, expressing her uniqueness.</p>
		<p>Many things we cannot even predict will come of the choiced made by people since 2016 build this world.</p>
		<p>Kizuna AI's efforts, Sora and A-chan's reaching out to Yagoo and their Christmas miracle...</p>
		</br>
		<p>I suppose virtual YouTubing will see more such miracles, like that one.</p>
		<p>"God works through people" - huh...</p>
		</br>
		<p>Anyhow, all of the friends that have done so many things to get virtual YouTubing here are celebrated.</p>
		</br>
		<p>Folks such as A-chan and Sora should be remembered as heroes whose passion for something that wasn't there before birth a new current in the world.</p>
		<p>The dream of idols.</p>
		<p>The dreams of virtual YouTubing. Everyone's.</p>
		<p>The dream of an AI who could talk and speak to everyone.</p>
		<p>The dream of a company that was different and which through it's failures taught the world valuable lessons for new attempts to make virtual YouTubing even more cool.</p>
		<p>The dreams of many girls to do something.</p>
		<p>The dreams of many girls to help people.</p>
		<p>The dream to educate.</p>
		<p>Unity.</p>
		<p>Connection.</p>
		<p>Beauty, and such mutual respect.</p>
		</br>
		<p>This is virtual YouTubing.</p>
		<p>This is the world I was mesmerized by when at 1 AM I was studying Math to unwind from a day of helping others and suffering to help others, at the age of 15, since I felt someone had to do it, the more I read about the off things in the world.</p>
		<p>When I saw a song by Gawr Gura called "Reflect" and clicked on it, and could not make out what box to put her into, as I put most people, for easy helping them in that way I thought oh-so-best at the time.</p>
		<p>When my belief that people aren't really unique was shattered for a second time, five years and so since I was first opened up to the world by the Internet.</p>
		</br>
        <p>This is the Intrenet.</p>
        <p>A place where anyone can become anything, no matter their past or present, and where any moment can be made beautiful...</p>
        </br>
        <p>And this is virtual YouTubing and the dream of something called "idols".</p>
        <p>People that inspire.</p>
        <p>Call them what you will - magical girls, hunters...</p>
        <p>They inspire everyone to believe and live an awesome life, which is their birthright.</p>
        <p>They are agents of God (God is love, anyone that gives love serves the God I know in my heart), to whom all miracles belong.</p>
        <p>They do not have to do it all alone.</p>
        <p>They do not have to give up their uniqueness.</p>
        <p>Thus is that dream.</p>
        <p>"Idol".</p>
