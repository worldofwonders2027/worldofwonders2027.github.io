		<p>A very great financial structure where Phase Connect's bank account is everyone's bank account. It's like - if a great singer is robbed - they can always refill that bank account since their bank account is everyone's bank account, actually.</p>
		<p>The profits of this are in the billions, as hard as that may seem to digest.</p>
		<p>The influence is not so relevant, but I can say that it is bigger than the one of today's Hololive.</p>
		<p>Our dear friends at Hololive will probably innovate too...</p>
		<p>I want to see sparkling gem of Hololive English, Koseki Bijou, bring virtual YouTubing to Tiktok.</p>

		<p>I will begin ending this book with a quote:</p>

		<h2>"A genius is a man who has discovered how to increase the vibrations of thought to the point where he can freely communicate with sources of knowledge not available through the ordinary rate of vibration of thought." - Napoleon Hill.</h2>
		</br>
		<p>And, as WORLD ORDER song "Permanent Revolution", about the relationship between China, Japan, and Korea, says in one of it's lyrics (一つの世界へ) :</p>
		</br>
		<h2>"Permanent revolution towards one world."</h2>
