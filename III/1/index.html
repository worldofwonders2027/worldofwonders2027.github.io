		<p>Unfiyd Healing has brought about a new way of marketing with their Operation Unity beginning in June of 2024, and tested on a smaller scale over the previous year.</p>
		<p>Jason has introduced this marketing system where you actually help people gain their own platform and educate them on that, and the profit from people's joining Unfiyd TV with your link is 50%.</p>
		<p>I will go even further, and I will also have lower prices than Unifyd (Most people won't pay a lot of money for spiritual knowledge you can get for free in books. I love your work with EES, but Unifyd TV - I honestly would only buy it if I was really passionate about hearing your message. There's a little - entry barrier - honestly.)</p>
		<p>Let's thank Jason for his wonderful work, and his amazingness, as a human being.</p>
		<p>Let's also notice that you can do even better!</p>
		<p>Open-source marketing has just begun.</p>
		</br>
		<p>Or has it really "just" begun...</p>
		</br>
		<p>We should also begin looking to personal marketing, of which Napoleon Hill gives a lovely example in Chapter V of his book, "Think and Grow Rich".</p>
		<p>A woman made an advertizement for a man's product, and then, for her son.</p>
		<p>This personal ad allowed him to join the company, offering his ideas to the company (in a similar marketing style to my offering my ideas to Phase Connect), and thus he was able to start his journey into that business not from the button, but from the position of junior executive.</p>
		</br>
		<p>As Napoleon says, too often the people that "start at the bottom", as society encourages us often, come to see themselves as "the bottom" and never really go up from there a lot.</p>
		<p>We have to stop starting by seeing ourselves as average, and instead see and believe ourselves to be nice.</p>
		<p>Then we can start marketing ourselves, from our belief, as seriously awesome at the job we want to do!</p>
		</br>
		<p>I suspect the craze for personal marketing that Napoleon predicted in the 1930s will soon happen, in the coming decade.</p>
		<p>Employment agencies and old methods of personal marketing shall be swept aside by glamorous websites, and true passion, rather than force.</p>
		</br>
		<p>As Napoleon Hill said, and as I agree very strongly with this message, those who carry on to their belief in rule by force, rather than the new ruling that has emerged since the 15th century and before, slowly - rule by cooperation -</p>
		<p>They will become among the rank and file, as humanity chooses to step further into the path of profitable kindness.</p>
		</br>
		<p>It is de-centralized systems that will bring about the fall of poverty and lack.</p>
		<p>For example, if you have paid attention, the DCI model is de-centralized, and every model and idea we have mentioned here can be applied by multiple people at the same time - provided the target public is different enough. I supsect this will be worked out with basically no issues, except some funny ones along the way...</p>
		<p>There is no promotion of personal or social power over others, or dominating sexual practices, or any kind of manipulative, negative, self-centered practice. The key to understanding why self-centeredness is limiting lies in the word "centered". As always, de-centralization wins... (Do not take my words toooo literally for this saying...)</p>
