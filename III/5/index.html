		<p>At last, we come to a peaceful and serene dream...</p>
		</br>
		<p>Welcome to Alaska, close to the Canadian border.</p>
		<p>There, I have asked president Donald Trump for permission, if you have to ask for permission to build towns, I am not sure, and he approved.</p>
		<p>I would build a little town to further diversify the beautiful nation of America with another kind of culture available to visit within the borders of this lovely nation.</p>
		</br>
		<p>A town like a town in Sword Art Online.</p>
		<p>As you come from the wood cabin we will look at in a bit to the southeast, through the forest, you walk by a few tree-cutters. They use axes.</p>
		</br>
		<p>Then, you go through a rural area with lovely gardens for the houses, some having benches in front of their yards where you can sit!</p>
		</br>
		<p>You walk further in and enter the town, an urban Renaissance-style town with houses with stone and wood, and with a lovely stone pavement - well built, with stone-colored well-refined rocks that you walk on.</p>
		</br>
		<p>To the west of town there is a forest, and to the right a beach, where the children can go play on the beach.</p>
		<p>The lake is connected to a river, and to a waterfall that falls from more elevated terrain, to the northeast of town, though not to the north, where there is more forest at around the same elevation level.</p>
		</br>
		<p>To the north, I am still considering whether to add something interesting there too!</p>
		</br>
		<p>And then, to the southeast, there is this lovely cabin where I'd like to live.</p>
		<p>A cabin in the woods, with a lovely balcony with wooden grilled bars, beyond which you can gaze upon the scenery.</p>
		<p>As I sit in my chair, I look to the left and see the town and forest, to the right forest and lake, and there is one more piece to this scenery, which we shall focus on by looking forwards.</p>
		<p>On the northnortheastern edge of the lake, from the position of our house, looking, there is a waterfall which flows down from the cliffy rocks, beyond which immediately there lies forest too.</p>
		<p>So many beautiful trees...</p>
		</br>
		<p>With this, I rest in my chair, and am sure: "My work is done."</p>
		<p>There is still a lot to do, but my work can be said to be - done...</p>
		<p>I happily look forwards to talking with my friends, anyone really, invited to the house...</p>
		<p>This is the kind of dream anyone can see become real.</p>
		<p>For indeed, are not all dreams divine?</p>
		<p>I would even go as far as to call them "Divine", with a capital "D"...</p>
		<p>Zzzz.....</p>
