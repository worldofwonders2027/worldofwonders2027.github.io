		<p>The legal system is failing because it does not understand a basic thing I will illustrate through three quotes from Leonardo da Vinci + a bonus quote.</p>
		<p>"Art is never finished, only abandoned." - making laws is like art.</p>
		<p>"To develop a complete mind [...] Realize that everything is connected to everything else."</p>
		<p>"A poet knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to remove."</p>
		</br>
		<p>For clarification, you may study the three principles presented in I/1 and consider their implications now.</p>
		<p>The implications of this kind of ruling by inspiring people, rather than rules, inspiration being the end of barriers, become even clearer in III/4.</p>
