		<p>When studying human brainwaves, for example, you might use an EEG to measure the brainwaves, and conduct research like that -</p>
		<p>However, the whole research becomes stupid if all you focus on is that, and you don't focus at all on the experience of someone operating at these frequencies of thought.</p>
		</br>
		<p>This is a big mistake we have made in contemporary Western medicine.</p>
		</br>
		<p>The second mistake we have made is the belief that it is fine to sacrifice something to save something else.</p>
		<p>This is the so-normalized insane fact of Western Medicine, where you take pills to help you with something, pills which break something else becuase of the toxicity that they further inject into the body.</p>
		</br>
		<p>In short, these pills do not actually remove the acidity, toxicity, etc. or help you change your diet, etc. (related to mistake one), and keep things going.</p>
		<p>We can give a lot of names to this like "It only treats the symptoms.", but in essence, Western Medicine is not hollistic, a.k.a. focusing on the health of the whole body.</p>
		</br>
		<p>As a conclusion of adopting this premise, and the premise that people (their experience) are wonderful -</p>
		<p>You have just solved most mistakes done by contemporary medicine.</p>
		</br>
		<p>The third premise of a healthy medicine should be the notion of not forcing people ever, and always looking to listen and find ways for everyone's seeming weaknesses to become strengths.</p>
		<p>Just as Napoleon Hill's nearly unable to hear son became a helper for thousands of people who could not hear and thus had a pretty awesome life *as a result* of his *seeming* weakness.</p>
		</br>
		<p>Thus, let us stop seeing schizophrenia, ADHD, autism, Aspergers, etc. as mental illnesses, or even neuro-divergence, and let us see them as one with fortune and successes!</p>
		</br>
		<p>These are the three premises that a doctor can use, and where I have seen, where they are not used, misery for the doctor and patient.</p>
		<p>"1. Everyone's experiencing of a happy life AND your knowledge matter."</p>
		<p>"2. Treat someone's body hollistically."</p>
		<p>"3. Every weakness is an opportunity."</p>
		</br>
		<p>I know of the endless harm that pills cause to people, most especially to children, whose lives are ignored, and who are taught to hate themselves as broken, and are thus enforced upon them, the most innocent of society, a view of a malevolent world and self...</p>
		<p>I know of doctors who beat people up in psych wards from a relative who has a friend working in a psych ward, who once called to tell my relative happily how she just beat someone up.</p>
		<p>I have been, because of an accident I was right to try and find opportunity in, since indeed, it allowed me to meet teenagers who were being treated like chores and to whose unique ideas no one wanted to listen to but me.</p>
		<p>My presence there had more effect on their mood after suicide than all the doctors' efforts - since I was a role model, and spoke to them about the topics everyone else had shunned them for, like spirituality and religion-</p>
		<p>I have a brother with autism, and I cannot tell you how lovely he is, and how he is actually able to swim, and has skills.</p>
		<p>One of my hopes, in the future, since I will have the resources, is to take care of my brother, or help my grandmother on my mother's side take care of it, as has been her wish for a while, instead of his spending time in a home for kids like him (though admittedly, man, I have to admire these ladies, they actually create a decent home for kids like him, at least...) - you will know I am a fan of exceptionalism, but I love decent too.</p>
		</br>
		<p>I have seen psychologists refuse to listen to people as friends and always treat them as "Professionals!"</p>
		<p>This makes psychologists, as things stand, less cool than going to a pastor.</p>
		<p>Truly, if anyone wants counseling, you should go confess your sins to a pastor.</p>
		<p>This is the truth. - I have met so many lovely pastors and so far, only once, in that psych ward, did I spend a few hours with a lady working there that was genuinely caring for the people, and not just being *nice*, *polite*, oh *so bright*...</p>
		<p>I am also fairly certain, though I have no evidence as of now, that many psychologists and psychiatrists cheat their exams.</p>
		<p>My grandmother has also brought to my attention that there is evidence, it appears, that big pharma works with some psychology school to create the theory that is taught in schools so as to encourage their profits, such that psychology and psychiatry in essence at as giant matrices/cultures which are presented as truth because of people's unawareness and unwillingness due to not being told - to care about their inner reality too, not just circumstances.</p>
		</br>
		<p>I forgot to mention this: Is it fine that I was threatened with being tranquilized in a psych ward if I didn't take the pijamas I was offered, although I was very friendly, simply becuase I, however, was acting in a very confident way, which they thought was "psychotic". ("How can anyone be happy getting to a place like this?! I could never be!" - "becuase I was never taught about that...")
		</br>
		<p>The previous advice also works for the police system, with which I have also been amazingly blessed with accidents, like when I was collecting trash in a park and apparently the area was a place where people sold drugs, so...</p>
		<p>xd, luckily that time, I met a lovely police officer, who had no problem walking with me home, instead of in a care. (The police is there to protect me. I don't give anyone authority as "superior" just because some law book and govern-ment official said it.</p>
		<p>Anyways, look to the word govern-ment to find out more about it - "govern", "ment", from mens, mentis, "mind".</p>
		<p>The word "govern" also has a second meaning in legalize (this is real stuff, listen, don't just shut off becuase it's outside what someone told you in school, someone who was just like you and didn't study Law, anyhow.) - the meaning is "to bend".</p>
		<p>So government = "bend mind".</p>
		<p>That is what it is.</p>
		</br>
		<p>You don't need government. You need *leadership*.</p>
		<p>Take heed of this and apply the three principles in any domain and you can do miracles, together with strong passion, for which you can check out a book by the man I mentioned previously, Napoleon Hill, titled "Think and Grow Rich".</p>
