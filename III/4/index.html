		<p>It has been my dream since June 2022, following Jesus's teachings, to help people in prison.</p>
		<p>Now we begin with a simple effort, likely in 2024.</p>
		<p>The effort will be the creation of a public ministry, similar to LLResearch's ministry for seekers in prison, where folks in prison can write to Phase Connect and have their messages read.</p>
		</br>
		<p>The DCI model allows us to create a place where people can gather, and I will advertize it as a place where you can learn about people's experiences in prison.</p>
		</br>
		<p>You would be surprised how many people would be interested in that.</p>
		<p>I want to present a little maxim - a truth - for everyone:</p>
        <p>"There's someone that will love you whatever weird situation you throw out there."</p>
        </br>
        <p>There is also a community that will be super interested in you whatever situation you throw out there, and BECAUSE of that situation, as an OPPORTUNITY.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Learn to see this, and your lonely days are over... This is also a big premise of our Beyond Dating initiative. (BeD)</p>
        <p>I want it to be noted, to illustrate how much power spontaneity love has, I came up with that label right now, on the spot!</p>
        </br>
        <p>I say this to illustrate that if YOU keep DESIRING to meet people that will be awesome with you and right for your growth and magic!</p>
        <p>It can happen!!!!! 100%!</p>
        </br>
        <p>Let us learn from Koseki Bijou, who decided to join Hololive, and who would not become a virtual YouTuber, no matter what, unless it was in Hololive, where she fell in love with the girls there, and *had to join Hololive*.</p>
        <p>She applied twice and failed, and the third time she got in to Hololive, and the dearest love of her life, which she had made through her LOVE and BELIEF.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Or, learn from me, who delivered these ideas to Hololive after also previously sending them: - Once on Discord and Email in September 2023, though more limited than they are today;</p>
        <p>- Once in July of 2024 through Discord after gaining more experience with virtual YouTubing and so much more, but not phrased well enough!</p>
		<p>- Once through an email on August 7th. Now phrased beautifully and explaining the philosophy well, BUT not doing marketing and believing that it was *noble* to say "Whatever will be will be"!</p>
		</br>
		<p>Thus, it was only my fifth attempt, where I knew this is what I wanted so much I *knew* it had to happen, if my vision is right, which I believed it was for sure...</p>
		<p>Considering how I would interact with Phase Connect's existing members, now, and more on how I'd interact with existing viewers, I studied that super ardently.</p>
		</br>
		<p>And here we are, in such a manner that shows that, just as a 17-year-old could do this, if you can do 5% of all this, you will be *rich* and happy, even in jail!</p>
		<p>Show your inmates your magic.</p>
		<p>Become a success story and show the government what a shitty system they made, and how YOU defeated the lies of this whole world, for everyone.</p>
		<p>Are you ready?!</p>
