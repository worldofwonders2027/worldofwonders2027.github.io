	    <p>I would love to conduct a study of the oil industry, seeing if oil truly has to be harmful to nature.</p>
		<p>If it is harmful, I will discontinue working with it, but if it isn't, I'd love to look deeper into it's uses.</p>
		<p>I don't like electric cars, for the record - the pollution created in making a battery is often half of that which a gas car will have done in it's entire life, and let's not forget that there needs to be work to get that electricity, as with the fossil fuel.</p>
		<p>This is just an idea, and it illustrates the power of helping people who know what they're doing do what they know and be known to the public.</p>
