	    <p class = "center toplinks"><a href = "../../">&lt&lt-- Return to Main</a> --- <a href = "../2">&lt-- Previous Page</a></p>
		<p>We will explore many methods to learn and teach.</p>
		<h2>Programming, Web Development, Operating Systems</h2>
		<p>The kind of web development taught by W3Schools for HTML, with some methods I would love to teach myself, since the basics are often not very focused on. (Have you heard about the marquee element? A lovely friend showed it to me, and it is actually one of the big things that inspired me to start learning web development.)</p>
		<p>CSS is taught very well by people like Kevin Powell - self-proclaimed CSS evangelist.</p>
		<p>For JS you may look to Caleb Curry, who also teaches C very well.</p>
		<p>Though, it is notable, for C, you may also want to use the textbook Programming in C, which is like an updated version of the holy book - it is the New Testament - for "The C Programming Language".</p>
        <p>Before getting to more web development, Caleb is honestly an amazing teacher for so many things, and he is still doing new things in cryptocurrency and making new tutorials.</p>
        <p>He teaches C++ and C# (though don't be surprised by it's strange style) well too. Can verify, I took most of the C++ series and some of the C# series.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Goodness, there are so many lovely programming languages out there, some written in styles less familiar to beginner lovers of Programming, or those who merely seek a job~</p>
        <p>One of them is PHP, who may be learnt at freecodeacademy with a great easy tutorial for any beginner to Programming, as I was when I took it, with only a little Python experience since my dad had inducted me into the world of Programming, and a bit of knowledge of C with no application since my friend inducted me into that.</p>
		<p>As to databases, honestly, if you just play with it you'll get it. If a 14-year-old could do it and make a chatroom-making service like Discord because they reaaally wanted to quit Discord and give their friends something to use - you can do it.</p>
		<p>For the record, I later quit the Internet as a whole and we still parted, for now, for we are never truly alone, but that only happened 7 months+ later that we spent together!</p>
		<p>This is the power of having technical skills - not having to bow down to any tech company.</p>
		</br>
		<p>And of course, this is the same power that technical skills like building give you too. Get someone to teach you these - the same goes for doctors - I don't want my surgeon to have taken an online course..... probably... I mean...</p>
		<p>It's best if you don't need a surgery in the first place, I suppose, but still, mate, if I actually get to you, I...</p>
		</br>
		<p>Anyhow, we will move on, for Analysis, I suggest the book Structured Analysis and Systems Specification - you cannot find this book on libgen last I checked (maybe now that I mention it soon it will be there) - buy it!</p> 
		<p>For design, you'll learn it as you go along, probably - most Programming books teach you enough structured Programming that they actually teach you Design too.</p>
		<p>I will also, one more mention on Programming, ever forget my time with Racket. It has such a lovely guide, and reverse Polish notation is so fun!</p>
		<h2>Languages - Literature</h2>
		<p>For literature, there are so many cool books, and so many cool people that can offer you book ideas.</p>
		<p>As to languages, I will anyhow have certain works like Parvenus of Old and New, a Romanian book, or the Apolodor Book, translated, the first being a very potent antidote for today's confusion about "schizos!".</p>
		<p>Rucka would recommend us some books, for example: "Brothers Karamazov", "The Fountainhead".</p>
		</br>
		<p>If you make YouTube videos, always remember to study to make them cooler.</p>
		<p>Practice making your typing speed faster - just a day or two will be spent a lot on that, and you will gain that time back many times, from my experience, I guarantee it.</p>
	    <p>Typing speed is for everyone.</p>
        <p>There are some lovely books on operating systems, I forgot to mention this, but the best resource is a channel called Queso Fuego, and several series on YouTube teaching Assembly and beginner operating system bootloader creation. Just do it!</p>		
		</br>
		<p>To learn Languages, for many European languages you can use the old Micahel Thomas tapes: https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/learning-european-languages-michel-thomas/.</p>
		<p>Generally, consult Luke Smith's articles on Language for learning any language.</p>
		<p>As to Hebrew, try hebrewpodcasts.com, hebrewpodcasts on YouTube. They are lovely, underrated!</p>
		<p>Let us all learn Hebrew and love our Jewish brothers and sisters!</p>
		<p>Judaic culture will be one of my focuses for exploration and encouraging international communication!</p>
		</br>
		<p>For German, Duolingo is - actually a good start.</p>
		<p>You'll pick up Spanish easy if you speak a Romance language, and I believe Michael Thomas has a tape on it.</p>
		</br>
		<p>If you need inspiration to study Sanskrit and Latin watch Armonian's videos for Sanskrit, and for Latin, Farya Faraji's songs, such as "Belisarius".</p>
		<p>That said, for a long-term study of a language, it is worth noting that you will have to show up every day - even when on a trip you best try it.</p>
		<p>The real reason most people fail at things and are forced to [accept life] is because they are unwilling their false attachment to other people's opinions - their limitations - which are not their true free self.</p>
		<p>By becoming yourself, you free the world.</p>
		<p>This is one meaning I may point you to of the Buddha's words: "When I awoke, the world awoke with me." - though there are endless more ways to interpret and speak this passage's depth and truth.</p>
        <p>You do not need to conform, in other words.</p>
        <p>The degree to which you are willing to accept opposition for being truthful is the degree to which you have chosen illumination to truth. (Just look at the early guys that practiced today's Science's adventures with the church, man.)
        <p>And look at how thanks to them we are here today, whatever you think of them, able to end slavery if we work together, with the church not wielding the power of being the Roman Empire, in essence.</p>
        <p>We live in a time where the greatest nation on Earth is a democracy and the second has had to adapt - not the other way around.</p>	
        <h2>The Study of History and Geography - Easier Than Ever!</h2>
        <p>As to the study of History and Geography, for Geography, go watch some Drew Durnil videos!</p>
        <p>Some strategy game videos from ISP, your local ISP, Alex The Rambler, Bokoen -  they may be fun.</p>
        <p>You should also, if you want to deepen your Geography knowledge, or if you want to learn without YouTube, you should study with Geography quizes.</p>
        <p>E.g. A quiz about the countries of the world, or about the major rivers of the world, or the rivers in your country, etc.</p>
        <p>You would be surprised how many quizes exist.</p>
        </br>
        <p>For History, go watch Kings and Generals, The Great War, House of History (especially for Prussia's History right now), Jabzy (his recent coverage of Islamic History is amazing, and his coverage of Axis plans if they had won WW2 is honestly - just - amazing - and so educatiational). I learnt so much from it about nazi philosophy too, and got to really understand where the nazis had gone wrong in their thinking far deeper than any other place looks at things.</p>
        <p>Eastory is an amazing mapper you may check out for coverage of the military situation of WW2 and WW1, and a few more conflicts + a few more videos.</p>
        <p>Real Time History, Epic Marche...</p>
        <p>TH(O)R is a lovely podcast on the History of Rome, and the maker of it has also made a podcast on the History of Byzantium, though I can only vouch for TH(O)R's quality, since I have only watched it, and investing the time to watch The History of Byzantium enough to learn a lot is an investment you should make at your discretion.</p>
        <p>There was a lovely channel called Ottoman History Hub, though it doesn't seem to be active anymore and has removed some map videos, with their, it seems, working with Kings and Generals to produce their series on the Rise of The Ottoman Empire!</p>
		<p>So cool!</p>
		</br>
		<p>I find alternate history-making to not be something that will bring you a lot of clear technical value, but it is a fun thing to try!</p>
		<p>If you want to try it, Alternate History Hub, Monsieur Z, and whatifalthist are some lovely channels.</p>
		<p>Whatifalthist inspired 12-year-old me, in late 2019, to convince the History teacher to let me, through persistance, to make a project not about History, but alternate history, researched based on actual History.</p>
		<p>It was then that I realized why whatifalthist always said "But things start getting unpredictable once you get this far into the future...".</p>
		<p>I thought "Oh, he's just being modest." - no. No.</p>
		<p>Before we go any furhter, I'd like to remind everyone that History books are also a great source of fun if you can find one at a library that looks cool to you, or maybe at your school, a teacher donates an old book.</p>
		<h2>Video-making</h2>
		<p>There are some things you can only learn from practice. For example, thumbnail-making for YouTube videos.</p>
		<p>You will never get how fun it is until you make them. The experience of getting the image, drawing on it.</p>
		<p>It is lovely.</p>
		<p>And the experience of making titles too, though (presumably) smaller!</p>
		<h2>Astrology, Numerology and Tarot</h2>
		<p>For Astrology, you should go check out Joni Patry's videos and her website at galacticcenter.org, where you can learn Vedic Astrology with Joni Patry today.</p>
		<p>It is such a lovely website. You can also join her Patreon for exclusive benefits.</p>
		<p>This is not an ad but Joni Patry's videos, and to an extent Molly Mccord's, have taught me what Astrology is really about.</p>
		<p>Astrology is about really having fun with the science of Vedic Astrology - although some folks might not like that name - it is such an intricate and fun artistic system.</p>
		<p>It is a scientific art and an artistic science.</p>
		<p>Next, moving on to Numerology, you should totally pick up a book on the subejct, at least so you can get a good idea of the numbers' meaning and some essentials.</p>
		<p>You will quickly find out, in the field, that Numerology is not actually used by most people to make predictions in any way, but that it's given meanings by people, who then use it as a sign, by the power of the Law of Synchronization of Energy.</p>
		<p>It is often used in Tarot, Numerology, adding to it's beauty.</p>
		</br>
		<p>It is interesting to note that president Putin has a few astrologers and numerologists.</p>
		<h2>Science and Math</h2>
		<p>Chemistry - Go watch ASAP Science's video on the periodic table and learn that song - write it out.</p>
		<p>The Organic Chemistry Tutor also has some nice videos.</p>
		<p>You may also check out a book on Chemistry and study it!</p>
		<p>I for one like using an old French book from 1968!</p>
		<p>Old books are also useful for Floriculture, Pomiculture, and other practical applications of Biology.</p>
		<p>Biology is really made up of The Basics, and The Details. I cannot offer you full guidance on how to learn Biology right now, but if you go looking, you will find stuff!</p>
		<p>Physics is great. Veritasium's videos are a great starting point, obviously, just as Numberphile or Computerphile or 3blue1brown's videos are a great starting point on Math and computers.</p>
        <p>Physics has a lot of good textbooks for it. The Math Sorcerer has some videos on it, though some of the textbooks recommended do require calculus.</p>
        </br>
        <p>For Mineralogy you are best off buying an encyclopedia.</p>
        <p>The same goes for Anatomy, I would imagine.</p>
		</br>
		<h2>Spirituality</h2>
		<p>Kyle Cease, Aaron Abke, Eckhart Tolle are wonderful teachers on anything.</p>
		<p>Teal Swan is a great teacher on relationships and success.</p>
		<p>Alex Ferrari runs the world's most beautiful spiritual podcast I've ever seen - Next Level Soul.</p>
		<p>We believe in you Alex!</p>
		</br>
		<p>Also, to get more into specifics - Aaron has the best map-like scientific study of ascension.</p>
		<p>Kyle is wonderful if you want help with emotions and shadow work and encourgament if you're feeling stuck in any way - controlling - whatever it is - go to Kyle Cease and your trauma will become a few children out there rescued. (Kyle donates all proffits from his events to OUR, which hopes to have us all go beyond child trafficking!)
        <h2>Mentors and Mindvalley</h2>
		<p>Nothing beats going out there and doing things and meeting people and having people help you for real, not just put you in debt, as some folks may have done to you in the past...</p>
		<p>I suspect if you need help with that, Mindvalley is the place for you.</p>
	    <p>Mindvalley is like YouTube, but for content that changes your life.</p>
		<p>They have hundreds of series like "The Art of Manifesting" by Regan Hillyer, a series I love and which helped me bridge the gap between all my inner work and outer.</p>
		<p>Or maybe you would like Vishen's course on Silva Ultramind, or "Calling in The One" or "Quantum Love", to meet your soulmate in the next 6 months, or maybe you would like to change your health life in a conscious way.</p>
		<p>Maybe you would like to master a growth mindset, or take "Speaking With Spirit" and deepen your connection with God and joy with Agape.</p>
		<p>Or perhaps you would like to take Mindvalley's series, "Build Your Dream Community", as an influencer, and learn how to build the best community, most lovely community, for your viewers.</p>
		<p>Or perhaps you would like to take Mindvalley's series on true, real, raw confidence, or maybe Mindvalley's series, "The Transformational Leader".</p>
		<p>Once you are hooked to Mindvalley, you will never stop loving the platform, and will not want to go back.</p>
		<p>Go get Mindvalley right now. Go search "Mindvalley Discount Link".</p>
		<p>If you don't have the money in your bank account, keep desiring it, and you will eventually have it.</p>
		<p>Remember this old saying from Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of The New World, said by Richter:</p>
		</br>
		<p>"Courage is the magic that turns dreams into reality."</p>
		<p>"They are words someone said to me long ago."</p>
		</br>
		<p>I will also quote another saying from that beautiful game (which you can, for the record, if this is of any interest to you, play using Dolphin Emulator or by finding a second-hand Wii):</p>
		<p>"Are you a man, or are you a dog?"</p>
		<p>Speaking of that, we return back around full circle, games can be a great motivator for going out there!</p>
		</br>
		<h2>Remember, and Let It Sink In</h2>
