		<p>Point four deals with changes in learning method in schools. </p>

<p>I will begin proposing at the school I currently study and forwards from there that people consider if they may be interested in using tutorials from our new tutorial open-source website (I told you this all mattered later, what we did earlier). </p>
</br>

<p>Now, if you pay attention, from here, before discussing point five, you will notice that by making people perceive the virtual as the same as face-to-face we have allowed testing of ideas in the virtual world before testing them in the physical, where the perceived level of personal threat is higher. </p>
</br>

<p>This is the big reveal.</p>
