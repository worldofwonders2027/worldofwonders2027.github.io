		<p>We shall work on the building of communities for young people in schools. </p>

<p>This should provide a better experience to school. </p>

<p>There is so much to say here, but I will begin by saying one thing. </p>

<p>It is not necessary that all schools adopt our new model - </p>

<p>It is only necessary that some do. </p>

<p>Then, I will ensure students know to have the courage to move to the ones with clubs they are interested in. </p>
</br>

<p>This is a similar tactic to the one that will be used for point four, which is (spoiler spoiler) about unique teaching methods in school - something you will know I am also an expert on. </p>

<p>It is a very similar point to what we are doing now, if you notice, in the way of clubs' uniqueness for students and teaching method uniqueness being both about unique methods and pluralism, which we will promote as the alternative to rigidity, which we will respect, though offering an alternative. </p>
</br>

<p>Now, as to how I will actually get this club thing started. </p>

<p>This too will require work from me. </p>

<p>1. I will have to move schools until I find the right middle-to-upper class school.</p> 

<p>I have picked this social class because the very rich kids will feel jealous that a poorer school has awesome clubs and they don't, and poorer kids will feel, still, that it is relatable, that school.</p>
</br>

<p>I will begin the first club and run it myself. That should be an amazing experience and adventure!</p>

<p>2. I will compile, after a while, a list of traps you can fall into, successes, advice, and everything in general, and create a website with resources for people to start clubs, promote the idea of clubs (charisma and openness and honesty), and overall resources for one's betterment as a club leader, or for your small community. </p>

</br>
<p>Unlike Japanese clubs, this will be a more libertine spirit in clubs, although to minimize resistance, we will make as many parallels between this and Japanese clubs, while talking, of course, about the differences, as a kind of way to make these clubs even better from the lessons people have found in Japan with school clubs. </p>

<p>Japanese clubs will be a great inspiration, though I suspect this dream too should soon outgrow me- </p>

<p>But not yet!</p>
</br>

<p>We only have one club so far.</p>
</br>

<p>3. I have to put up posters about this website with resources (yup, paper posters) around the schools that I find are great for more test runs in the city I live in. </p>

<p>I will also, around this time, begin working on expanding this movement internationally (with translated web pages and everything, of course, I am also great web designer, or I can hire some nice people to pls help, for my time and mai sanity).</p>

</br>
<p>Anyways, that little weird way of speaking aside, I hope you can see how this idea is viable and can provide a new sense of community for young people at many schools.</p>

<p>There are many questions to consider, such as how to help ensure everyone is included, but a lot of the inclusivity question, I'll say, will be solved by the fact that to be a registered club you need to follow the three principles of leadership.</p>

<p>"See everyone as awesome."</p>

<p>"Help everyone create the mood and environment of your club, including physical details."</p>

<p>"Help everyone's dreams be able to come true together!"</p>

</br>
</br>
<p>Alrightie!</p>

<p>Everything clear so far?</p>
