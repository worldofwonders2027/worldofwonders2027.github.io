		<p>A restaurant chain where restaurants are way more than just restaurants.

<p>These restaurants should serve as community centers, face-to-face CEs, FtF CEs. </p>

<p>These will be created by compiling lists of people that are awesome from the area and first finding a core community of around 50 to 150 people who are willing to visit the restaurant at least once in a while.</p>

<p>This will require me to get the counsel of some people in the industry, but I think I get the basics. </p>

<p>Setting up a supply chain, etc., I have looked into it a bit, it shouldn't be hard considering how many people have done it. </p>

<p>These centers also will have as a core giving extra food to the poor. </p>
</br>

<p>If you can't eat any more, no problem - No need to eat for the kids in Africa which can't (if you know that saying). </p>

<p>If you don't, basically, you know that the food you leave goes to a good cause and isn't being thrown away, and that's in any world better. </p>

</br>
<p>After building a core community (a proven business technique for creating communities - honestly, I am shocked no virtual YouTuber has used this since it makes having a nice community not just up to who finds you but up to you - Hololive kind of does it with new debuts.)</p>

<p>- after that, you can allow anyone to come to the restaurant once the core community have gotten to kind of know each other and be helpful to the people that attend beyond that, so that they can set the mood - a mood which will repell bouncers and other wrongdoers without needing so much rule-enforcement.</p>

<p>A lot of the money other restaurants spend on defense will be counted as profits.</p>

<p>Hehe~</p>
