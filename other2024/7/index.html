        <p>Gone are (and never really a thing) the days where you go online and have to go on X or Instagram.</p>
		<p>Making an RSS feed post will soon be as easy as making a post on X - nay, it will be even easier because you can easily post on multiple feeds at the same time, or switch between feeds as I envision it, and someone will get the news instantly once the RSS post is posted to the server.</p>

		<p>Also, I may set up a broadcast, though I may have to ask for some help with this.</p>
		<p>Maybe folks who have run a podcast before, like Yuko Yurei, can help...</p>
