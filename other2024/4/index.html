		<p>- Rucka Rucka Ali: I fully agree with Objectivism, though perhaps not some Objectivist views.</p>
		<p>I would love to give Rucka a platform to talk about Objectivism to a bigger audience.</p>
		<p>Like Voltaire's old addage goes (actually, he has a lot of addages): "I do not agree with a word you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it."</p>
		<p>I used to quote this addage when I was 12, I really loved it (in part because I really loved France and it's culture at the time and was studying French).</p>
		<p>Let us hear the Nucka talk!!!</p>
		<p>And let's stop judging the nucka from the book title and l i s t e n u p!</p>

		<p>- Jreg: I would love to see Jreg run a kingdom inside the world's first DCI - the second kingdom.</p>
		<p>I can't wait to see what he will do with it.</p>
		<p>Will he divide the land into three duchies: One based on the political compass, biggest; One based on the - pff - based on the mental illnesses, and another, third, based on the third Jrera.</p>
        <p>Jreg has been my teacher of political philosophy - the only teacher anyone could need - though I cannot call him my only teacher in our lovely case...</p>
        <p>Jreg has made politics accessible to anyone, and I truly respect him for that, and his more recent works related to that and more general philosophy, and...</p>
        <p>Let us not forget Jreg's work to bring influencers together in Canada at a place.</p>
        <p>I admire the man as I do so many great influencers we have on the Internet.</p>
        <p>I want to see what he does with a kingdom.</p>
		<p>Let's do it, J-reg lovers!
        </br>
        <p>- Beyond: I will continue looking for opportunities for collaboration with folks who are in agreement with a vision of an Internet for everyone, and where there is equal opportunity for the people, and I will persist in this even in any area.</p>
		<p>I'd like to write to the singer Marina, once, maybe, for example.</p>
		<p>I wonder if she'd like to become a virtual YouTuber...</p>
		<p>I wonder which of her styles she would choose to use.</p>
