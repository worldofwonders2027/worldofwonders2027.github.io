		<p>Virtual YouTubing is sometimes stuck because of really stupid limiting practices which are enforced as rules rather than a choice.</p>
		<p>Stuff like "You have to get a new model when you join muh Agency Authority Corp-oration (corpus = dead body, body; oratio = oration, speech --- corporation = dead body speak)", or, another limit: "You must wait for n time, always! Before you debut!"</p>
		<p>Predatory practices (the "have" in them)!</p>
		</br>
		<p>Let us learn from Vedal, who without the name "agency", and through making something amazing that people want to collaborate with, the wonderful AI Neuro-sama, has created, in essence, a group of virtual YouTubers who share their love for Neuro-sama and will gladly work together.</p>
		<p>Let us promote the kind of virtual YouTubing which is like the landscape of the Earth, with hills, plains, and mountains, and different plants that grow there. (This is doubly true considering our DCI world.)</p>
		</br>
		<p>Phase Connect will debut a new generation, "Infinitia", who will also have a forum board for anyone, infichan.</p>
		<p>With time, they should have a new kind of merch, which are goods that you can use and give to anyone, that are not bound to a particular culture (e.g. "We The Internet People"), but to any culture that believes in progress.</p>
		<p>I will work towards the development of a publishing house for books written on our open-source plaform for writing tutorials and suggesting edits to others' tutorials, like on Github with code (See I/3). A publishing house like lindypress.net, made by Luke Smith, about whom we will talk in other2024/5.</p>
		<p>Then, we will talk more about some initiatives that have been done previously on the Internet that I believe we may take up - something we will begin discussing in other2024/4, for the record, where we will look at people with whom a collaboration may provide value for their communities and everyone.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Let us now discuss this new generation for Phase Connect...</p>
        <p>- fallenshadow_vt, Shondo - it should be obvious why.</p>
        <p>- Rye The Vtuber (Yuko Yurei) - I would guess she left Idol considering the buying of Idol by Brave that she must've been told about.</p>
        <p>If not made a saint for her honesty and courage and daring to try new things during her time as Yuko Yurei, she should be given, again, influence.</p>
        <p>- Fuyo Cloverfield - And, besides being included in this amazing generation, I will make her queen of the world's first DCI kingdom, since she seems to love MMORPGs.</p> 
        <p>Yes - not Pippa - I want this not very well-known someone to take that position!</p>
        <p>- KyOresu - I would suggest her joining anyhow, but she happens to also be a friend of Pippa's!</p>
        <p>Besides that, I believe in loving people even if what they are accused of is true.</p>
		<p>Also, I actually study at a Russian high school in Bucharest at the time of writing this.</p>
		<p>Russia is a lovely country, and so is KyOresu's singing.</p>
		<p>Dear jewbrothers (name for folks that love Idol Corp) - "yes, you can have it all!" - as they say.</p>
		<p>Believe it! And make your dreams true too! - If God is love and abundance, to know God is to know love and abundance!</p>
		<p>If you are someone with typical entrepreneurship leanings, at this point, I will recommend Napoleon Hill's "Think and Grow Rich" to you - a book I will speak on more later in detail.
        <p>- As staff, or even a virtual YouTuber, Aviel-san, join us!</p>
        <p>I have so much respect for you, and for your showing your lovely face, and being so daring given the virtual YouTubing world of 2022.</p> 
        <p>You remind me of one of my first spiritual teachers, a dear man to me - just like you are honestly dear to me.</p>
        <p>He was a Sufi - he taught me about the world's religions a lot, and I loved his videos.</p>
        <p>I would love to work with you also on ventures in Israel, such as expanding our restaurant chain there sometime in early 2026, when I would like to fly to Tel Aviv and meet you in-person.</p>
        <p>Don't give up on the idol dream! I don't care whatever didn't work before.</p>
        <p>Yes - "it is impoooorrrtant we learn from the past and grieeeve, and so on - but I honestly don't give a s**t about the past.</p>
		<p>The past is not real.</p>
		<p>The past is made now.</p>
		<p>Thus, it is said:</p>
		</br>
		<p>"Perfection is when we're here."</p>
		<p>"Perfection is where we're going to."</p>
		</br>
		<p>Any kind of movement is better than no movement or feeling isolated or having to push and pull hard to earn money.</p>
		</br>
		<p>- Aquwa - I was just recommended one of her videos and I can tell at first glance if someone is awesome - I have a radar after meeting hundreds of people and so on. She should join Phase Connect.</p>
		<p>We have to (This is a joke.) get her before Vedal does!</p>
		<p>We've already had virtual YouTuber Filian be corrupted by the magical Coding and cooking powers of this man!</p>
		</br>
		<p>- Mari Yume - underrated.</p>
		<p>I don't know why but I just feel like saying at this point, it may be helpful to anyone we have mentioned so far - once someone joins my Phase Connect, if I need to go to that length to help someone, anyone, I will self-induce a mental illness, step by step, I will find a way, and I will heal it, just so I can find a way to help you with it.</p>
		<p>Now, back to Mari Yume, yes, she is underrated, totally awesome, I can't wait to see her Mystery shine! (The next Phase Connect generation's name, perhaps, will be related to Mystery? (No.))
		</br>
		<p>- Little Nii - The aestethic of Phase Connect will have to change quite a bit before her joining would be possible, but she seems super awesome - I used to find her videos awesome in 2020, while doing homework from online school, so, God bless Little Nii for helping out a 13-year-old.</p>
		</br>
		<p>We will now move on to people which I am not interested in the joining per se thereof, but which are included in this vision since they are super awesome at things!</p>
		<p>- Nanobites is cool, she should be the prime minister of the first virtual parliament and figure out how to make it all work with no laws and only three guiding principles, mentioned in I/1 World of Wonders.</p> 
		<p>- The Internet's wolf spirit Ra, Wolfychu!</p>
		<p>Recently, as of the time of writing this, JaidenAnimations has won 700.000$ in a MrBeast competition and put it to use for artists, as a scholarship.</p>
		<p>I think we should go EVEN FURTHER in supporting artists by creating a free virtual academy of arts in the new DCI system.</p>
		</br>
		<p>I need the help of someone that knows their stuff, and since she's already interested in this whole virtual YouTubing thing (If you guys didn't know, she has a virtual YouTubing channel!), she is the perfect teacher for making art, and role model for *how* to use it and show it to people.</p>
		<p>I believe in you, Pika- ah! It just stuck me why people say "chu"!</p> 
		<p>It's from Pikachu!</p>
		<p>Pika~Chu!</p>
