		<p>We are here today thanks to the great work of a lot of cool folks.</p>
		<p>We talked a bit about Luke Smith, but I'd like to start this section with someone I admire, known as Terrance Andrew Davis.</p>
		<p>I would like to encourage people to work more on operating system development in our times. There is a lovely channel I love called Queso Fuego whose videos I used to build a mini-OS myself in May of 2021.</p>
		<p>There are also lovely books on operating system design, and I love the ideas Terry designed into his operating system that I would love to see used more.</p>
		<p>Right now, I think Arch is very good, but I'd love to see a retro OS also that can be used on any computer.</p>
		<p>I would also love to have someone help me conduct an investigation on whether the BIOS of most computers with Intel chips is a form of spyware.</p>
		<p>I paid for the tech, so I get to play with it - that's the rule since ancient times with anything you buy - you buy it, it's yours.</p>
		<p>We call everything besides that "debt", and there are certain laws we can talk about that regulate debt and what you can do with it.</p>
		</br>
		<p>Now, on to Luke Smith! Lux, lucis... "Shine" - no wonder this Latin-loving landchad from North America shines so brightly.</p>
		<p>He has actually built a lot of cool things.</p>
		<p>based.cooking is in essence the inspiration for an open-source platform. Before that, I'd been running a tutorials website and videos since September 2021, but only in late February 2022 did I get the idea of an open-source academy.</p>
		<p>I still remember how exciting that first project's designing and building was.</p>
		<p>Ah, and I still remember all the things I got to do with tech thanks to Luke's videos and landchad.net.</p>
		<p>And let us not forget lindypress.net, and Luke's overall videos...</p>
		<p>And his lessons on Vim, on LaTeX, on Arch Linux (I tried Gentoo against your advice, also, father, a friend at the time encouraged me to do it~).</p>
		<p>And let us not forget his videos on shell scripting, which inspired me to work on a script to create RSS feeds, and I believe there was also an option to update them.</p>
		<p>At the time I didn't know of sc-im, also, and I didn't want to, under ANY circunmstances, use PROPRIETARY software, like Excel, so I built my own Excel shell script where you put in the size of the table and could, if I remember well, fill thingies - cells - in.</p>
		</br>
		<p>I am so grateful for the fun I had - and let us not forget Luke's beloved podcast, notrelated.xyz, which I love a lot too...</p>
		<p>I will forever remember you, Luke - as a hero of mine.</p>
		<p>As someone who always stood up for what was right, and who taught me to be a great role model.</p>
		<p>Thank you, endlessly...</p>
		</br>
		<p>There are so many things to say about Luke and what he has done for the Internet that we might never finish if we get into it...</p>
		</br>
		<p>I am also thankful to all the influencers and people that have contributed to the Internet we have today, many of whom influenced or changed my life.</p>
		<p>That is the Internet I know - where everyone gets to be free and where everyone is accepted on the Internet.</p>
		<p>It is by people like Luke that the principles I have proposed for the Internet are made, and let us not forget one more thing about Luke's message...</p>
		<p>Spontaneity.</p>
		<p>He rarely made cuts in his videos, as he said in one video, being able to record without editing is a testament to one's authenticity, and it serves as advice to any future endeavoring bloggers and video makers.</p>
		<p>Before learning how to film with edits and effects, learn to film yourself as is.</p>
		<p>Chris Broad, Abroad in Japan, has made a great channel about Japan, which inspired me to learn Japanese, and which offers a lot of resources, like Remembering The Kanji 1 by James Heisig, Tae Kim's guide to Learning Japanese for Grammar, or Genki 1 and 2 for vocabulary.</p>
		<p>He even mentions the lovely Japanese Zuiikin' English program... Which is one way you can learn pronounciation, I guess.</p>
		<p>Together with the many beautiful Japanese pronounciation channels (e.g. did you know that sankaku is triangle and shikaku is a square? I would love to see an old Michael Thomas tape (the new ones aren't as good) style guide to pronoucning Japanese.) and anime.</p>
		<p>Vlogging is truly an amazing offshoot of the Internet that has given great things to the world, while we are here.</p>
		</br>
		<p>I am glad to say that so many folks have inspired little things in the model I present to you here, such as "Hey, this is how you can learn Japanese in a cooler way.".</p>
		<p>Or, there is a lot of cool things to say about Chris-san, or most YouTubers, honestly, and even the ones that are related to drama were once kids, and are just a bit - different, in a sense... though not so different.</p>
