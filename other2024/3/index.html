		<p>Interviewer: "There was all the criticism. There was advertizers leaving. We talked about Bob."</p>
		<p>Elon: "I hope they stop."</p>
		<p>Interviewer:"You hope?"</p>
		<p>Elon: "Don't advertize."</p>
		<p>Interviewer: "You don't want them to advertize? What do you mean?"</p>
		<p>Elon: "Go fuck yourself."</p>
		<p>[...]</p>
		<p>Elon: "Actually, what this advertizing boycott is going to do is it's going to kill the company. And the whole world will know that those advertizers killed the company. Everyone will document it in great detail. Let's see how Earth responds. And it will be gone because of an advertizing boycott. The judge is the public."</p>
		<p>Interviewer: "And you think that the public is going to say that Disney is making a mistake?"</p>
		<p>Elon: "Yes."</p>
		<p>Interviewer: "And you think the public is going to boycott Disney?"</p>
		<p>Elon: "They already are. Is this coming across?..."</p>		
		<p>Elon: "Let the chips fall where they may."</p>
		</br>
		<p>Spoken like a man that knows what it's like to be accused by people of things you never did and have no one believe in your ideas but your belief in people...</p>
		<p>If you guys did not catch it, basically, if you have a good enough argument, being accused is an opportunity, in fact, even, to show the truth.</p>
		</br>
		<p>Being attacked by the negative actually kind of becomes a good thing, and certainly an opportunity.</p>
		<p>Let me rephrase this - if someone tells you something that you can verify from your experience -</p>
		<p>Just as easily as "the sky is blue", if we agree on the meaning of the color blue and what it's refering to -</p>
		<p>Something they can verify innerly...</p>
		</br>
		<p>So - here - Ghandi, Nelson Mandella, Elon Musk, and Donald Trump teach us a lesson.</p>
		<p>Step 1: Create a plan for what you are going to say if companies and people attack you.</p>
		<p>Step 2: Be courageous and "risk" (you're not actually risking anything in reality but the part of you that isn't sure about your own sense of reality and common sense) everything for the truth.</p>
        <p>You don't even need to get it all 100% right, you just need to be better than the people accusing you of something that is not common sense.</p>
        <p>For example: "You're different. You should take pills. It's not good to be too smart either." - oh, would you guess what I told a psychologist that told me that...</p>
        <p>"Wasn't psychology supposed to be for everyone? Wasn't it inclusive?"</p>
        <p>It's an amazing story.</p>
        </br>
		<p>If you guys have ever felt scared of being insane, I will talk more about some stories I have about psychologists and psychiatrists in a bit.</p>
        <p>We're talking psychiatrists beating people up, cheating their exams and getting in for an easy job, children being given pills and made to feel broken instead of encouraged, or teenagers I have met and helped after experiences in psych wards.</p>
        <p>Any aura of authority you feel about psychologists and psychiatrists as "a different kind of people, smarter", will be dismantled at once!</p>		
		<p>We have not mentioned this up to this point, but I have helped poor folks, taught classes, and done a bunch of things.</p>
