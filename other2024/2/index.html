		<p>An alternative approach to idol concerts that I will suggest to folks that don't like just being idol-like is the approach of showing your virtual body - or physical body - it's your secret model...</p>
		<p>And, just going around the stage, doing flips, doing crazy things, etc. while singing and dancing!</p>
		<p>You can sing any song, or do anything, also.</p>
		<p>For example, I will propose, for people that want to be unconventional, that you go ahead and sing Rucka Rucka Ali's songs.</p>
		<p>I have loved the man since 2020 - beautiful songs - they're all about the subjective approach you have to them - not just the words - I have found.</p> 
		<p>They lend themselves sooo well to interpretation and play!</p>
		</br>
		<p>Marina also has some beautiful songs, just as does Rave The Requiem, whose Stigmata Itch album is brilliant.</p>
		<p>Or maybe you would like to sing video game OST music, like music from Kirby, or Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of The New World, or Tales of Symphonia, or the PokePark games (Where is PokePark 3?!) - all games I love.</p>
		<p>Or maybe you would like music from other cultures, such as Armonian's beautiful works of art mixing Western culture with Indian music and language.</p>
		<p>Let us also talk about all the anime songs you could sing on stage - I don't care about copyright - There is no such thing as "no" until you accept it as a no.</p>
		</br>
		<p>Or maybe you would like to sing Jreg's amazing songs, or other influencer music, or maybe you would like to just create a meditative or ASMR environment for your audience on stage!</p>
		<p>Spontaneity can give you better results than thousands of years of planning if you can learn to love this moment deeper than your next breath, and from there enjoy it.</p>
