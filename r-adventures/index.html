		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<p><b>Out there</b>: I have helped poor folks change their lives from situations most of society would consider worse than what we call "schizos" online; Have helped fund childrens' schooling with my allowance for months and written them a Math mini-textbook, and given them books and notebooks to use; Have taught classes and taken initiative at all schools I have been at since the beginning of sixth grade, building a social life and everything from no friendship at all with anyone at the beginning of 2018 and isolation and bullying, middle of fourth grade; Have helped teenagers that felt discouraged by others; Loved by the whole school I am at since over two years ago in 8th grade, despite any challenges always shining for folks and giving them awesome presents for Christmas - "based", to quote them, books,, and things no one else gives - and advice when asked; Acted as role model to yet more children on the streets.</p>
		<p><b>Virtual world</b>: I built a YouTube channel with over 250 subscribers at the age of 11-12, though I then focused on other things, and this channel had a very diverse topic range and people really loved me - with a few videos with thousands of views to prove it. My style was making fun YouTube videos but talking about serious topics once in a while, like Article 13, COPPA, and how demographics was actually pretty a big background theme in my favorite anime at the time, Love Live: Sunshine; I made a tutorials website and tutorial videos that my friends loved on HTML, and aimed to expand this even more into an open-source learning platform, but I decided I wanted to first study spirituality and my inner world, so I went on a two year+ journey where my main focus was that, full of epic experiences, super-failure, and great successes; Have studied virtual culture for the past almost 1 year and four months, with the intent of giving something to the Internet, since I remembered the time I made a mini-game in C with Allegro5, and wanted to experience building something awesome again. - I got way more than I asked for!</p>
		<p><b>Confidence</b>: Most important of all, no matter if people neglected me as a child - no matter if people accused me of things that were false, triangulating besides my back to manipulate me - I always kept believing *no matter what*, and what I found is, paradoxally, that everyone is thinking "If only I believed harder in my life", when that is not so important... What matters is that we are happy now, and that we keep going even further, always, as Japanese band WORLD ORDER's lyrics go in the song "PERMANENT REVOLUTION", as to the relationship between China, Korea, and Japan, in "Permanent revolution towards one world", together, whoever you are... Thus we come back around and find out: "I am a nobody."</p>
