		<p>There are three principles by which these systems run:</p>

<p>1. "Everything is awesome."</p>

<p>This means that the way to rule is by cooperation.</p>

<p>By inspiration - not by inspiring limits.</p>

<p>2. "Everything is connected to everything else, either directly, or indirectly."</p>

<p>This means that everything is in an environment. In terms of the Internet and world this means we will focus a lot on the interfaces for these environments - how we are inspiring people.</p>

<p>3. "Everything is possible."</p>

<p>And, what are we inspiring them to do - of course - anything they dream of!</p>
