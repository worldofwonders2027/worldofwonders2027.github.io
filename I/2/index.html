		<p>	For principle two, we have to create a new kind of interface for the Internet, an alternative to "socials".</p>
		
<p>I call them DCIs - Dynamic Community Interfaces. They are dynamic in that they feel real, raw, and valuable (which principle three will be dealing with). They are for community as contrasted with just a social thing, "social drinking", "socials", etc. They are interfaces.</p>

<p>They act as CEs, Community Environments, for a community. </p>

<p>One example of DCIs is the MMORPG model, which would allow for influencers to run kingdoms inside these MMORPGs.</p>

<p>At first there should be one test kingdom in one DCI with duchies, counties, barons, and mayors. </p>

<p>There should then be more kingdoms, and eventually, there should be a program, a kind of seed, that can be used by anyone to create a DCI for their friends and themselves. </p>

<p>These should be connected, all DCIs, through a kind of network, creating a new kind of Internet.</p>
</br>

<p>This is not enough to provide the greatest for folks, though, and there we move to principle three of designing a new Internet.</p>
</br>

<p>Now that we have included everyone and designed an interface that reflects this all inclusiveness and connection in a real way (this interface, do note, should be designed with care. I will hire Programmers with experience tapping into intuition (actively used by many companies), people with experience with Silva, to design this interface by tapping into Alpha, Theta, and Delta brainwaves and allowing more dynamic ideas to flow for how to make the DCI feel real and raw).</p>

</br>
<p>- Yes, now that we have that -</p>
