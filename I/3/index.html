		<p>For principle three, you are looking at all the dreams that will be coming true.</p>

<p>I have a few that are important to begin this system, and which tie in to future systems in changing the face-to-face world, although this may not be apparent at this point.</p>

<p>- An open-source platform where people can post tutorials and suggest edits to others' tutorials, like you can post videos on YouTube, or post code on Github, and suggest edits to others' code.</p>

<p>- An academy building for people to teach subjects using any textbook written by folks for that subject - This is a trial phase for something we will refine and later suggest to schools in the face-to-face world in a certain way. (Just you wait! I am telling you - this gets crazy!)</p>

<p>- Other business ideas people may have - cultural centers - shurches (I will not use Internet slang ever again in this vision description until we are done!), etc. </p>

<p>- I have also considered setting up a news broadcast. We will discuss this more later.</p>

<p>- An RSS feed would also be great - we will touch on this more later - I refuse to use Twitter - RSS is such a lovely alternative without any replies - just updates - like a newspaper - I really like that style a lot.</p>
</br>

<p>Moving on, this is phase one of the plan: The Internet.</p>
